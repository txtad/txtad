# Tad Marko

I am a software developer who started with Basic, then [Turbo Pascal 2.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-pascal/2x) and [Microsoft C](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-c-c/3x). These days I work on loyalty systems for independent grocers and convenience stores. I code in Bash, Java 17, Python, C++, as well as administer Ubuntu Linux systems and maintain networks that include IPSec and OpenVPN links.
